These types of models can be trained by collecting better datasets, designing stronger architectures, learning better features, and applying techniques to avoid overfitting while improving model generalization. Throughout history, machine learning has come a long way in terms of algorithms and techniques. With the rise of deep learning, many algorithmic bottlenecks were solved. But this introduced a new challenge: the need for massive compute power and larger datasets. While deep networks excel at learning parameters, they can easily overfit on smaller datasets—memorizing patterns instead of learning general representations. This leads the model to “game” the dataset rather than truly understanding it. Overfitting in Computer VisionVision brings unique challenges to object detection, especially because real-world settings can vary unpredictably. Lighting, angles, backgrounds, occlusions—the range of variation is endless. Historically, it wasn’t possible to capture all of these variations in datasets. This limitation made early computer vision models struggle in real-world scenarios. For instance, a CNN trained on smaller datasets like CIFAR-10 can perform impressively well—achieving a top-1 error rate below 3%, which is roughly equivalent to human-level performance. But real-world object detection isn’t as simple. Generalizing across varied environments, objects, and contexts requires much more effort, data, and careful design. Fun fact: State-of-the-art models like ResNet and Vision Transformers trained on large datasets such as ImageNet have surpassed human-level accuracy on classification tasks, achieving top-5 error rates below 5%. Yet, deploying them in the wild still requires extensive fine-tuning and domain adaptation. Availability of Vision DataToday, high-quality, large-scale datasets like ImageNet, COCO, and Open Images have made it possible to train deep vision models at scale. ImageNet contains over 14 million labeled images across 20,000+ categories. COCO (Common Objects in Context) offers over 330,000 images with more than 1.5 million object instances annotated. Open Images by Google includes 9 million images with image-level labels, bounding boxes, and visual relationships. These datasets have been a turning point in the progress of computer vision. They provide not just volume, but also the variety necessary to help models generalize beyond lab conditions. That’s a short note from my side as I continue learning about machine learning and computer vision. Sharing these small thoughts helps me keep track of things and hopefully adds value to someone else too.","link":"2025/07/12/Deep-Learning-for-Vision-Small-Datasets-vs-Real-World-Challenges/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Introduction","slug":"Introduction","link":"tags/Introduction/"},{"name":"AboutMe","slug":"AboutMe","link":"tags/AboutMe/"},{"name":"MachineLearning, ComputerVision, ModelTraining, DataSets","slug":"MachineLearning-ComputerVision-ModelTraining-DataSets","link":"tags/MachineLearning-ComputerVision-ModelTraining-DataSets/"}],"categories":[]}
