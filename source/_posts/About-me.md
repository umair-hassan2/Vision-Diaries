Welcome! My name is Umair Hassan, and I work as a backend engineer at Motive on their Fleet Card product.  
At my job, I mostly focus on backend systems, from payment gateways to rebate computation engines.  
While it's interesting, sometimes it gets repetitive working on similar problems for long stretches.

Finance is a challenging domain — it demands a lot of care when coding, as even a small downtime can mean losing millions of dollars.

Recently, I was working on SQL query optimizations because our background jobs were consuming too much CPU on our pods. We realized many of our queries needed tuning.  
While working on that, I started digging deeper into database internals and optimization concepts. I came across some interesting ideas during that time, which I plan to collate and share here in future posts.

Alongside my backend work, I’ve also started learning about Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) as a side quest.  
Part of it is about adding something fresh and intellectually stimulating to my routine — I’ve always loved mathematics and algorithms, and I find it deeply fulfilling to contribute in some way to human scientific progress through learning and sharing.

## Purpose of This Blog

This blog is mainly about my Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) learnings.  
I've started reading research papers and technical blogs in these areas, and I’ll be using this blog to dissect and discuss them.  

It will serve as both my personal notes and a record of my learning journey.

Occasionally, I’ll also post about backend engineering — new things I learn or experiences worth sharing.  
I enjoy exploring the internal nuances of systems and the scaling laws behind them.  
I’ve always admired algorithms and clever techniques that power the massive scale on which the internet operates today.

## Why You Should Care?

Even though this blog is primarily about my own learning chronicles, I plan to share content with real depth and extra research, especially in ML and CV.  
I’ll also share experiments and interesting discoveries related to machine learning.

If you're a researcher, student, professional, or just a curious mind wanting to learn about these technologies, this blog might be a useful and approachable resource.

At some point, I’ll also start sharing posts on X (Twitter) and LinkedIn to have more open discussions about the content here.  
Hopefully, it sparks some good conversations and learning along the way.
