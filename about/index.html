My name is Umair Hassan, and I work as a backend engineer at Motive on their Fleet Card product.<br>At my job, I mostly focus on backend systems, from payment gateways to rebate computation engines.<br>While it’s interesting, sometimes it gets repetitive working on similar problems for long stretches.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>Finance is a challenging domain — it demands a lot of care when coding, as even a small downtime can mean losing millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Recently, I was working on SQL query optimizations because our background jobs were consuming too much CPU on our pods. We realized many of our queries needed tuning.<br>While working on that, I started digging deeper into database internals and optimization concepts. I came across some interesting ideas during that time, which I plan to collate and share here in future posts.</p>
<p>Alongside my backend work, I’ve also started learning about Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) as a side quest.<br>Part of it is about adding something fresh and intellectually stimulating to my routine — I’ve always loved mathematics and algorithms, and I find it deeply fulfilling to contribute in some way to human scientific progress through learning and sharing.</p>

<h2 id="Purpose-of-This-Blog"><a href="#Purpose-of-This-Blog" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of This Blog"></a>Purpose of This Blog</h2><p>This blog is mainly about my Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) learnings.<br>I’ve started reading research papers and technical blogs in these areas, and I’ll be using this blog to dissect and discuss them.  </p>
<p>It will serve as both my personal notes and a record of my learning journey.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I’ll also post about backend engineering — new things I learn or experiences worth sharing.<br>I enjoy exploring the internal nuances of systems and the scaling laws behind them.<br>I’ve always admired algorithms and clever techniques that power the massive scale on which the internet operates today.</p>

<h2 id="Why-You-Should-Care"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Care" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Care?"></a>Why You Should Care?</h2><p>Even though this blog is primarily about my own learning chronicles, I plan to share content with real depth and extra research, especially in ML and CV.<br>I’ll also share experiments and interesting discoveries related to machine learning.</p>
<p>If you’re a researcher, student, professional, or just a curious mind wanting to learn about these technologies, this blog might be a useful and approachable resource.</p>
<p>At some point, I’ll also start sharing posts on X (Twitter) and LinkedIn to have more open discussions about the content here.<br>Hopefully, it sparks some good conversations and learning along the way.</p>
